In React Router Dom v6,  a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook inside a component nested within other route components. If the parent route also uses `useParams`, there might be unexpected behavior or errors, particularly if the parent route's parameters influence the child route's behavior or rendering. This occurs because `useParams` only looks at the parameter values currently present in the URL for the specific component it's used in. This can lead to stale parameter values or incorrect rendering based on the parent route's parameters.
